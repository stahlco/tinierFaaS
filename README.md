This is a reduced version of [Dr. Tobias Pfandzelter's](https://github.com/pfandzelter) [tinyFaaS](https://github.com/pfandzelter/tinyFaaS).

---

**tinierFaaS** has just a shell runtime, running in a leightweight docker container (might change this to a even containerization option)
and only supports HTTP-Protocol.

**Reason:** This is the first time I ever worked actively with Function-as-a-Service and tinyFaaS abstracts the learning process through several
unimportant features which are not relevant just understanding serverless plattforms.
